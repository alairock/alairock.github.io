<p>This one is a simple trick, and one to remember. Add this little line to the controller (/App/Controller/UsersController.php to control how many results per page are loaded. You can also use this same method to manipulate the results in other ways as well (See this for more <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/core-libraries/components/pagination.html">details</a>.)</p>
{% highlight php %}
<?
public $paginate = array( 'limit' => 25, 'order' => array('Post.title' => 'asc'));
{% endhighlight %}
&nbsp;</p>
