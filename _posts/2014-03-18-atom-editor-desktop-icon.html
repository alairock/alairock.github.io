<p><a title="Atom Editor" href="http://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom Editor</a> is a brand new code editor still in beta, and my first reaction is 'Awesome!'.</p>
<p>As much as I love the fact that it is built on JS/CoffeeScript and (basically) chrome, I can't get over how nasty their icon is, so I made my own.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sixteenink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-18-at-8.16.26-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-276" alt="Atom Editor Desktop Icon" src="http://www.sixteenink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-18-at-8.16.26-AM-300x146.png" width="300" height="146" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in spirit of OpenSource I am giving away the icon for free. Click <a title="Atom Editor Desktop Icon 512x512" href="http://www.sixteenink.com/?attachment_id=277" target="_blank">HERE</a> to download.</p>
<p>If you want the vector version however, I am looking for a Dribbble invite, and would be happy to trade an invite for the vector.</p>
