<p>Sometimes you just need to get the query used by a find, for troubleshooting issues. This is especially true when troubleshooting ajax issues which don't typically have views, so DebugKit doesn't load for that page.</p>
<p>Just add this below the controller:</p>
{% highlight php %}
$log = $this->Model->getDataSource()->getLog(false, false);
debug($log);
{% endhighlight %}
Welcome!</p>
