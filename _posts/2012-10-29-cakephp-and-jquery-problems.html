<p>This issue plagued me for way longer than it should. Due to lack of documentation online I figured it would be best to represent it here.</p>
<p>I kept getting Black-holed. The most common answer I found online was to disable security altogether. (Seriously, don't do that). Rather, the correct answer via consensus in the #CakePHP IRC, as well as multiple other hidden forum posts was to disable it on a per hidden field basis.</p>
<p>Easy answer. Make this:</p>
{% highlight php %}
<?
echo $this->Form->input('w', array('type' => 'hidden'));
{% endhighlight %}
Into this:</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?
echo $this->Form->input('w', array('type' => 'hidden', 'security => false));
{% endhighlight %}

(The last one didn't work for me as was vastly suggested, but the following worked for me and should be an alternate)</p>
{% highlight php %}
<? $this->Form->unlockField('Purchase.x');
{% endhighlight %}
Happy coding!</p>
