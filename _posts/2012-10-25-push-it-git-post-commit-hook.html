<p>For a few months, every time I pushed a commit I would play a sound clip. (Specifically Push It by Salt-n-Pepa) This was just for kicks, but would take a few seconds to open my Spotify account and actually find/play the clip.</p>
<p>Recently I found a way to add it to my post-commit hook in git.</p>
<p>Open .git and navigate to the folder called "hooks". Copy the post-commit.sample and save it as post-commit.</p>
<p>Enter the following command:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
afplay "/path/to/file/Pushit.m4a"
{% endhighlight %}

Save and enjoy!</p>
<p>NOTE: This only works on mac.</p>
