## Docker + PHP + Composer nirvana!

Composer is a critical part of the PHP workflow these days. The problem I have with PHP today is the work flow is out dated, and with the advent of Docker life *could* be much better. I have found such nirvana, and I will show you how to implement this into your work flow. But first thing is you will need to understand how to setup docker, docker-compose and docker-machine on your desktop/laptop. I will do a mac setup tutorial soon, but in the meantime, there is plenty of resourses on the internet for setting that up.
