<p>This is just a quick post of a few things that are really bugging me about the podcast app by Apple. This is after a long time of us age and the few things I think I really need in this type of app.</p>
<p>Complete synchronization. This seems like a no brainer, but I'm not just talking about the ability to synch podcasts across different devices, or start&#47;stop times. I'm talking full synchonicity. (That's not a word, but it is now) I want to be able to see if I've EVER played an episode. Perhaps taking it a step further, a list of times listened to, or at least when it was last listened to.</p>
<p>Also, I don't know if this is a bug or a feature. But I have two copies of smodcast. I'm completely unable to delete either one of them from my phone. This seems like it should be a default function, not a "feature".</p>
