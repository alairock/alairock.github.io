<p>Laravel 4 is centered almost completely around routing. So organizing it is a must. There is no default organization for routes, but we can easily fix this.</p>
<p>Add the following to your `bootstrap/start.php` file:</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?
/**
 * Require Routes for better organization.
 */
$files = new FilesystemIterator(dirname(dirname(__FILE__)) . '/app/routes');
foreach ($files as $file)
{
    if ($file->isFile())
    {
        require $file->getPathname();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can create a `routes` directory inside the `app` folder and save your routes in there. You can name them whatever you want, but I like to name them after the controller I am working on.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
