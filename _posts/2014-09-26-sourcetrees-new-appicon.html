<p>I just updated SourceTree, and what did I find? They updated their logo! But the funny thing about it is their striking similarity to the icon I designed in March, 6 months before they released theirs.</p>

<p>Their icon in March<br />
<a href="http://www.sixteenink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sourcetree_icon.png"><img class="wp-image-290" alt="sourcetree_icon" src="http://www.sixteenink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sourcetree_icon.png" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>My icon designed in March<br />
<a href="http://www.sixteenink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SourceTree.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-281" alt="SourceTree Desktop Icon " src="http://www.sixteenink.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SourceTree-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Their icon, released yesterday<br />

<p>The similarity is striking. But alas, I don't care. It's just cool to see I was on the right path. :)</p>
<p>(Also, as of writing this post, if you did a google search for "sourcetree app icon", my icon is the first or second result)</p>
